# Layouts_Reactjs

Layout Component : defines the layout of the application.

The Layout component is used for organizing the layout of our application content using Row, Column, and Container Component. 

As compared to Reactâ€™s special children property, which allows only a single user interface content to be passed into the component, this option enables multiple UI content to be passed into the component. 
It simply accepts `children` as `props` and render them to the DOM together or without other child components.

Working with reusable layouts is a very good practice, because it lets you write code once and use it in a lot of parts of your application.
